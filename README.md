# A simple Java game engine for a 2.5D game

While some basic features were included with the tutorial, a few friends and I are looking to expand this basic engine greatly to create an in depth game.

To compile and run:

	1. Compile the .java files located in the src/ directory into a bin/ directory using the command

		javac -d ./bin [src files]

	2. Compile the class files located in the bin/ directory into a .jar with the command (while inside /bin)

		jar cvfm ../Game.jar ../manifest.txt bgibbons/ ../res/

	3. Run the Game.jar file
